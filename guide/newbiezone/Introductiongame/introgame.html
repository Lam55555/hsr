    <div class="title">Introduction to the game </div>
        <p><b>Honkai: Star Rail is a turn-based RPG</b> very similar to old-school JRPGs (especially the Final Fantasy series). The game is split into two modes: overworld and battle. In the overworld, you run around the map and when you encounter an enemy group, you will 'transfer' into the battle mode where you have to defeat the enemies in turn-based combat.</p>
        <p>We will talk about the overworld (also known as exploration) and combat modes in a separate section further down the guide.</p>
    <div class="title">Characters</div>
    <img src="/img/about_2.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Characters are the playable units in Honkai: Star Rail. They are obtained mainly via Warps, the game’s gacha system. However, some Characters can be obtained for free via in-game missions or events.</p>

    <div class="s-title">Character Stats</div>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>HP </b>- How much damage a Character can take before falling in combat</li>
        <li><b>ATK</b> - How much damage a Character deals</li>
        <li><b>DEF</b> - Reduces the damage a Character takes</li>
        <li><b>Speed</b> - Determines how fast and how often a Character will act in combat</li>
        <li><b>Crit Rate</b> - How likely it is for the Character to land a critical hit</li>
        <li><b>Crit DMG </b>- Determines the damage multiplier when landing a critical hit</li>
        <li><b>Break Effect</b> - Enhances Weakness Break effects (the amount of damage dealt upon it), the amount of DMG dealt by DoT's per turn and also how far enemy actions are delayed</li>
        <li><b>Outgoing Healing Boost</b> - Determines the amount of healing done by the Character’s Healing ability</li>
        <li><b>Energy Regeneration Rate</b> - Determines how fast a Character charges energy for their Ultimate ability</li>

        <li><b>Effect RES </b> - Determines how difficult it is for an enemy to apply a debuff on the Character</li>
        <li><b>Elemental Damage Boost</b> - Increases all damage a character deals. Note that there are seven different elements in the game and each element has its own separate Elemental Damage Boost stat</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="s-title">Character Elements & Paths</div>
    <p>Each Character in Honkai: Star Rail has an <b>Element</b> associated with them. A Character’s Element determines the damage type of their attacks.
    </p>
        <p>There are currently 7 Elements in the game:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li style="color: #979797;">Physical</li>
            <li style="color: #EE4737;">Fire</li>
            <li style="color: #2692D3;">Ice</li>
            <li style="color: #C65ADE;">Lightning</li>
            <li style="color: #61CF93;">Wind</li>
            <li style="color: #6057C9;">Quantum</li>
            <li style="color: #F3E137;">Imaginary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each Character in Honkai: Star Rail also has a Path as well. You can think of Paths as character classes. A Character’s Path will give you a general idea of what role that Character fulfills in combat as well as what Light Cones they can fully utilize.</p>
        <p>There are currently 7 Paths in the game:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>Destruction</b> (Focus on Blast and Single target damage)</li>
            <li><b>Hunt</b> (Focus on Single target damage)</li>
            <li><b>Erudition</b> (Focus on AoE damage)</li>
            <li><b>Harmony</b> (Focus on supporting allies, allowing them to do more damage)</li>
            <li><b>Nihility</b> (Focus on debuffs and Damage over Time)</li>
            <li><b>Preservation</b> (Focus on keeping the team alive)</li>
            <li><b>Abundance</b> (Focus on keeping the team alive)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="s-title">Character Skills</div>
        <p>Each character in Honkai: Star Rail has 5 different abilities that define their playstyle.</p>

        <div class="s-title">Basic Attack</div>
        <p>The Basic Attack ability is a Character’s auto-attack and is always available to use during combat. While generally the ability is considered a filler one that is used to generate Skill Points, there are some characters that do majority of their damage via their Basic Attack.</p>
        
        <div class="s-title"> Skill</div>
        <p>Skill is a combat ability that a Character can use with effects ranging from dealing damage to providing buffs for your allies. The Skill ability has no cooldown and instead requires you to expend Skill Point(s) in order to use it.</p>
        
        <div class="s-title"> Ultimate</div>
        <p>A Character’s Ultimate ability is generally their strongest combat ability. To use the Ultimate ability, it must first be charged through certain combat actions such as attacking or defeating an enemy. It must also be recharged after every use.</p>

        <div class="s-title">Talent</div>
        <p>Talent is the Character’s passive ability. Generally, it takes the form of a conditional effect where the Talent will provide some kind of benefit to the Character and/or their allies when certain conditions are met.</p>

        <div class="s-title">Technique</div>
        <p>Unlike the rest of a Character’s abilities, Technique is an overworld ability rather than a combat ability and is used before combat begins. Depending on the Character, using it will either initiate combat with a special attack or it will provide a buff prior to engaging the enemy.</p>

        <div class="title">Character Progression</div>
        <img src="/img/guide_character.jpg">
        <p>Upgrading your Characters in Honkai: Star Rail will enhance their combat capabilities, allowing you to challenge and overcome the more difficult content that the game offers.</p>
        <p>The main ways for a Character to grow stronger in Honkai: Star Rail are:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Increasing the Character level</li>
            <li>Upgrading the Character’s Traces</li>
            <li>Unlocking the Character’s Eidolons</li>
            <li>Equipping Light Cones</li>
            <li>Equipping Relics and Planetary Ornaments</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="s-title">Character Level and Ascension</div>
        <p>Each Character in Honkai: Star Rail has a Character Level ranging from 1 to 80 and gains additional stats as they level up.</p>

            <p>Once a Character reaches certain level milestones, they will need to be ascended in order to increase their level further. Characters start with a base max Level of 20. Each time you ascend a Character, their level cap will increase by 10 up to a maximum of 80. To ascend a Character, you will need to gather materials from the Stagnant Shadow Bosses and enemies in the overworld.</p>
            
            <p> Also, note that your Trailblaze Level (Account Level) will also determine how many times you can ascend a Character. Even if you have all of the required ascension materials, you will not be able to ascend a Character past a certain Level unless your account is also of the appropriate Trailblaze Level.</p>
